#Exercise 9-1

**E1 ∩ E2**: both dice are 1  Read: E1 AND E2
**E1 ∪ E2**: at least one of the dice lands on 1. Read: E1 OR E2  
**E1 \ E2**: the first die is a 1 and the second die is not.  

*note: ∩ = AND, ∪ = OR*

The union of two events A and B is the event consisting of all
outcomes that are either in A or in B  

The intersection of two events A and B is the event consisting of all outcomes that are in both A and B.

(a) Sample space = {(D,D,D) (N,D,D),(D,N,D),(D,D,N), (N,N,D)   (N,D,N), (D,N,N), (N,N,N)}  
(b)  
(i) Either pumps 0-4, 3-6 {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}  
(ii) Either pumps 0-4 or all odd pumps in use, {1,2,3,4,5}  
(iii) All pumps {3,4} in use  
(iv) All pump {1,3} in use  
(v) All pumps {5,6} (not A)  
(vi) Only {6} (not A or C)  

(c)  
A={{S1,S2,F3},{S1,F2,S3},{F1,S2,S3}}

(a)  
Pr(A) = 60%, 0.6 - Individuals that include optional mem card  
Pr(B) = 40%, 0.4 - Include Extra Battery  
Pr(AnB) = 30%, 0.3 - Extra Battery and Optional mem card  
Pr(AnB)/Pr(B) = 30/40 = 0.75 = 75%

(b)
Pr(AnB)/Pr(A) = 30/60 = 0.5 = 50%
