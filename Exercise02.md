##Cartesian Product\
(a) Cartesian Product of A{a,b,c} X Z{1,2,3,4}:
A X Z = {(a,1), (a,2), (a,3), (a,4), (b,1), (b,2), (b,3), (b,4), (c,1), (c,2), (c,3), (c,4)}\

|   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| *a* | (a,1) | (a,2) | (a,3) | (a,4) |
| *b* | (b,1) | (b,2) | (b,3) | (b,4) |
| *c* | (c,1) | (c,2) | (c,3) | (c,4) |

##Binary Relation\
(b) The binary relation over A and Z is a subset of the cartesian product of AxZ. \ If for example A was linked to all odd numbers, b was linked to even numbers, and c was linked to even and odd numbers, we would have a binary relation that looked like this: \
**L = {(a,1), (a,3), (b,2), (b,4), (c,1), (c,2), (c,3), (c,4)}** Which clearly is a subset of Cartesian product AxZ.
