#Exercise 1-1
**Supervised learning**\
When previous examples are taken into account and data is distinguished based upon it.

**Unsupervised learning**\
When data is disinguished without previously known examples.

##Association rule mining:\
**In which grade different sets of data supports each other**

##Clustering:\
**Putting information together in clusters**

##Outlier detection\
**Detection of rare coincidences that are different from majority of data**

##Classification\
**Assigning different pieces of data to different classes. e.g putting a mail into spam or non-spam.**\
